php -S localhost:8000

after that you can keep your css , 
js files in public folder put you can call them directly without public.
You can easily fix this issue, 
by adding {{ asset('public') }} in front of your css and js files.
for example
<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="{{ asset('public') }}/css/style.min.css"/>
<script src="{{ asset('public') }}/js/jquery.min.js"></script>
